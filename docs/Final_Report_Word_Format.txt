Chapter 1. Introduction

Background

We are developing our application, Lumiere: A Unified System for Insurance Claim Management, as per request of our client, a senior business analyst for the Janashakthi Group of Companies, a prominent Sri Lankan conglomerate with business interests spanning insurance, finance, real estate, and investment. Some of the companies within the group are, Janashakthi Insurance PLC, Janashakthi Finance PLC, First Capital Limited and Janashakthi Corporate Services Limited.

Within the organization, employees are often covered under group insurance policies for life and medical coverage, and in some cases, individual vehicle insurance. These policies are maintained through partnerships with multiple third party insurance providers. Currently, companies within the Janashakthi Group handle most of their insurance claim processing manually, relying on physical document submissions to the HR departments.

Since this is a very time consuming and confusing task, they are seeking a web based solution to standardize the operations occurring within the company more systematically.

We are developing this system based on our client's requirements, with a focus on streamlining the insurance claim process, enabling both employees and HR staff to efficiently manage claims, communicate, and carry out related tasks with improved accuracy and convenience.

Problem and Motivation

Problem Statement

Insurance claim processing within the Janashakthi Group is currently handled through a manual, document-based system and this is often a confusing and grueling task with delays and other such issues, especially due to having to communicate with multiple external insurance providers.

Current Problem and Current Process

When an employee faces an incident that requires an insurance claim, such as a medical emergency, some terminal illness or vehicle damage, they must initiate the claiming process by contacting the HR department of their respective company.

1. Initial Claim Request

The employee visits the HR department and fills in the required forms, including bio data, dependent information and details about the incident. Employee also hands over the relevant physical documents such as medical bills, police reports, photos etc. to the HR department. A HR officer verifies the employee's eligibility for the claim based on the assigned insurance policy.

2. Verification by HR

HR department cross checks the claim details with internal employee details and their assigned insurance policies. If there's any information missing, the HR officer informs the employee to resubmit the claim request or revise the documents.

3. Forwarding to Insurance Provider

Once the claim request is verified, the HR officer forwards the claim request to the relevant insurance provider(s) associated with the employee's insurance policies. This communication is done via email, and it requires HR officers scanning documents manually.

4. Insurance Provider Processing

The claims team of the insurance provider reviews the claim, validates the submitted documents, and decided on approval or rejection of the claim request. They also determine the claim amount if the claim request is approved. Their final decision is then sent back to the HR department for confirmation.

5. Employee Notification

Once a decision is made, the HR department notifies the employee of the outcome. The payment process is handled independently by the insurance company and a notification is sent to the employee.

6. Record Maintenance

All claim details, approvals, rejections, and communications are maintained manually in company files and spreadsheets. There is no centralized system to track claims, view policy usage, or analyze patterns over time.

This current procedure is prone to delays, document misplacement, and inefficiencies, especially when dealing with multiple insurance providers and a high volume of employee claims. This is the primary motivation for developing a Unifies Insurance Claim Management System to streamline and automate the entire workflow.
